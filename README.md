#Form, Input and Errors

##A technical test by SuperHi

Online education platform SuperHi kindly shared their [Front-end Engineer Test](https://superhi.notion.site/superhi/Front-end-Engineer-Test-Public-95677e57d07a4c11a2d2d6166bc83717) with me, which I completed and shared here. View it live on [Vercel](https://submission-test.vercel.app/).

The brief was essentially to create a form with some validation that redirects to a success page upon submission.

By completing this project, I learned about:

* the react-hooks-form library and `useForm()` hook
* hosting with Vercel
* NextJS' `useRouter()` hook
* NextJS' font optimisation feature
